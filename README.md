# Universal-DSA
This is my new Project which is related to DSA. It's one of the biggest project ever made through C++ by myself. In this project, You can perform any operations related to DSA like stack, linked list, trees, shorting, algorithms and more. And Yeah this project related to DSA so their lines of code are more then 5k. This project work as dynamically (Working on user input values).

Basically, This Project took my more then 10 days to complete it.
In this Project, I make more then 225 functions, Use 10 header files and some OOP's concept.
This Project is very beneficial for DSA Students and others because their all concepts which are related to DSA are coverd in this.

Instructions to apply this Project:-

(i) You can perform all the Operations at a time of running Program untill you chose the 'Exit' Option.
(ii) The all operation in this Project are based on run time and perform as dynamically.
(iii) The All Operations which are mentioned before starting the program, Each operations are based on their index number.
(iv) The All Operations are performed on the basis of their index number.
(v) Read the all captions carefully and then perform any operations which are you want.
(vi) Follow the all instructions according to this project otherwise You'll be get wrong output.

The All Operations with their types related to DSA, Which you can perform in this Project are,

1) Array
2) Matrix
3) Stack
4) Queue
5) Linked List
6) Tree
7) Heap
8) Hashing
9) Graph
10) Set
11) Map
12) Linear Search
13) Binary Search
14) Selection Sort
15) Bubble Sort
16) Insertion Sort
17) Merge Sort
18) Quick Sort
19) Heap Sort
20) Counting Sort
21) Radix Sort
22) Bucket Sort
23) Bitwise Algorithm
24) Branch And Bound Algorithm
25) Geometric Algorithm 

Note :- Basically, I coverd every importent topics of DSA which are mostly used in all over technical world with every detailed concepts. If any topic related to DSA which are not mentioned in this project, Then those topis are maybe similar to these topics which are already mentioned in my project or maybe those topics are not based on program they actually based on logics or algorithms of program(Those topics which are used on mostly logical thinking and algorithm concepts but their output will be same as their other or old types of algorithm).

If, You have any enquiry related to this Project, Please let me know.

Thank You.....
